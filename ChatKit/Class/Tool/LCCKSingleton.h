 `LCCKSingleton` is a generic class for Mac OSX and iOS that implements all the required methods to implement a singleton object. It's designed for subclassing.
 
 ### Subclassing Notes
 
 When subclassing `LCCKSingleton` you should think about your subclass as an ordinary class, `LCCKSingleton` makes sure that there is only one instance of your class.
 
 If you want to make your own initializer or override `-init` method your should check whether your singleton has already been initialized with `isInitialized` property to prevent repeated initialization.
